# GITHUB BOT

![](https://github.com/BhavyBansal24/Github-Bot/blob/master/SeleniumDrivers/github.png?raw=true)

### Prerequisit before use
* create a github repository (private suggested)
* Don't forgot to add a README file while creating repository
* and we are good to go

### Procedure to start the bot
* Clone the repository
* Download ChromeDrivers.exe inside the SeleniumDrivers folder (Do check the version while downloading)
* Proceed according to given comments in "main.py" file
* Run the file
* Enjoy watching the bot commiting to repository

## Uses of bot
* To make a github commit everyday (maybe for a Green Chart on profile), and not to waste time thinking where to commit 

## Further more
* Can create a bash script of the process, and make it auto-execute
  - First Condition : check using date if their is a commit beforehand or not.
  - Second : to execute whenever PC/laptop starts

## NOTE : 
* I created this Project just to try using **selenium** for a github bot, There are many better and faster bots available on web with different techniques.
* Project is for educational purpose only, Having no intentions to use this as a contribution hack on github.
* So as to not make fake contributions on this github profile , I have tested this bots working on a demo github account at this repository [here](https://github.com/bhavyyy/Comit_everyday)
